What is Docker?
Docker is a configuration management tool that is used to automate the deployment of software in lightweight containers. 
These containers help applications to work efficiently in different environments.

Features of Docker:

- Easy and faster configuration
- Application isolation
- Security management
- High productivity
- High scalability
- Infrastructure independent

Docker container is a software package that has all the dependencies required to run an application.
Note: A Docker Image is a template of instructions used to create containers

Docker Image:
A Docker Image is a read-only file with a bunch of instructions. When these instructions are executed, it creates a Docker container.

Dockerfile:
Dockerfile is a simple text file that consists of instructions to build Docker images.

Mentioned below is the syntax of a Dockerfile:

Syntax

# comments

command argument argument1...

Example

# Print "Get Certified. Get Ahead"

Run echo "Get Certified. Get Ahead"

List of Docker Commands for Creating a Dockerfile with example
Before we create our first Dockerfile, it is important to understand what makes up the file. 

Dockerfile consists of specific commands that guide you on how to build a specific Docker image. 

The specific commands you can use in a dockerfile are:

FROM, PULL, RUN, and CMD

FROM - Creates a layer from the ubuntu:18.04
PULL - Adds files from your Docker repository
RUN - Builds your container
CMD - Specifies what command to run within the container

Mentioned below is an example of the dockerfile with the important commands

FROM ubuntu:18.04

PULL. /file

RUN make /file

CMD python /file/file.py
